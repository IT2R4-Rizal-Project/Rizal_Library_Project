    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The <em> <strong> 19th century </strong></em> was a pivotal period in Philippine history, marked by colonial rule, social and political transformations, and the rise of nationalism. During this time, the Philippines was a land of social injustices, economic exploitation, and colonial oppression. However, it was also a time of awakening and resistance.

    <h3>Economic Change</h3>
    <p>
      Before the Spanish occupation our Forefathers have already been trading with the Chinese, the Japanese, the inhabitants of Siam, the Indians, Cambodians and with the natives of Borneo and Mollucas. When the Spaniards arrived the Spanish government carried on the existing trade relationships with this countries for a period.
    </p>
  <h4><strong>Galleon Trade (Manila-Acapulco Trade)</strong></h4>
  <p> 
    The  <b> Manila galleons </b> were Spanish treasure ships that transported precious goods like silk, spices, and porcelain from Manila in the Philippines to Acapulco, Mexico, between 1565 and 1815.
  </p>
  <p>
    • This trade connected the Philippines with Mexico for <em> 250 years </em>. It was a government monopoly of two trading ships — one navigated from Acapulco in Mexico to Manila for 120 days carrying some 500,000 pesos worth of merchandise, and the other sailed from Manila to Acapulco for 90 days with some 250,000 pesos worth of goods.
  </p>
  <p>
    • The Philippines sent mangoes, tamarinds, rice, carabao, Chinese tea textiles, and tuba (coconut wine) to Mexico, while guava, avocado, papaya, pineapple, and other goods were sent by Mexico to the Philippines.
  </p>
  <p>
    • This economic transaction ended on September 14, 1815, when Mexico gained its independence from Spain. It was stopped largely because of the efforts of Valentin Delos Santos, our representative in the Spanish Cortes (1810-1813).
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Suez Canal</strong></h4>
  <p>  The <b> Suez Canal </b>, completed on November 17, 1869, was a significant infrastructure project that revolutionized global maritime trade by connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, drastically reducing travel time between Europe and Asia.
  </p>
  <p>
    • It was an <em> artificial waterway  </em>connecting the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea in Egypt. On November 17, 1869, it afforded the Philippines and Spain a relatively effortless maritime route for Spanish trading.
  </p>
  <p>
    • The project began as an agreement between <b> Ferdinand de Lesseps </b>, Cairo's former French diplomat, and the <b> Ottoman </b> governor of Egypt in 1854 for de Lesseps to construct a 100-mile canal across the Isthmus of Suez. Construction commenced in April 1859 with forced laborers digging by hand with picks and shovels. European workers later arrived with dredgers and steam shovels.
  </p>
  <p>
    • The canal decreased the travel time from the Philippines to Spain from 3 months to 32–40 days.
  </p>
  <p>
    • <b> José V. Basco </b>, who became the first Governor-General to the Philippines under the Bourbon reign, arrived in the country in 1778 when the Galleon Trade was already failing. European industrialization and western countries brought an increased demand for raw materials, allowing the Philippines to leverage its agricultural potential toward economic transformation.
  </p>
  <p>
    • Basco's economic program aimed to develop and promote agriculture in the country to transform the Philippines into a financially self-sufficient colony.
  </p>
  <p>
    • The canal also enabled the importation of books, newspapers, and magazines carrying liberal ideas from Europe and America, which contributed to the political awakening of Filipino intellectuals like José Rizal, helping shape their nationalist views.

    <h3>Social Structure</h3>
    <p>
      During the 19th century, the Philippines remained under Spanish colonial rule, which had lasted for more than three centuries. The Spanish government exercised strict control through the Gobernador-General, who held absolute power. The friars of the Catholic Church played a dominant role in governance, education, and economic matters, often exerting more influence than secular officials.
    </p>
    <p>The society was divided into classes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Peninsular</strong> – Pure-blooded Spaniard born in Spain.</li>
      <li><strong>Insular</strong> – Pure-blooded Spaniard born in the Philippines.</li>
      <li><strong>Mestizo</strong> – Spanish mestizo: one parent is Spanish, the other is native; Chinese mestizo: one parent is Chinese, the other is native.</li>
      <li><strong>Principalia</strong> – Wealthy pure-blooded native professedly kadatoan descendant.</li>
      <li><strong>Indio</strong> – Pure-blooded native of the Philippines.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Cultural Change</h3>
  <ol style="padding-left: 15px; margin-left: 0;">
    <li>
      <strong>Emergence of Filipino Nationalism and the Ilustrado Class:</strong>  
      The 19th century witnessed the rise of the Ilustrados, an educated Filipino class exposed to liberal and nationalist ideas from Europe. Educated both locally and abroad, they became instrumental in advocating for reforms and fostering a sense of national identity. Prominent figures like José Rizal, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and Graciano López Jaena utilized literature and journalism to highlight the injustices of Spanish colonial rule and to promote Filipino consciousness.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cultural Renaissance and Artistic Expression:</strong>  
      This period saw a flourishing of Filipino literature, arts, and theater. Works such as Rizal's <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em> critiqued colonial society and inspired a sense of unity and purpose among Filipinos. The Propaganda Movement utilized various forms of media to disseminate reformist ideas and to cultivate a shared national identity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Educational Reforms and the Spread of Liberal Ideas:</strong>  
      The introduction of public education in 1863, although limited and controlled by the Church, marked a significant shift. It allowed a broader segment of the population to attain basic literacy. Additionally, many affluent Filipinos pursued higher education in Europe, where they encountered liberal ideologies that influenced their perspectives on governance and society.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Evolution of Clothing and Social Identity:</strong>  
      Fashion in the Philippines evolved as a reflection of cultural amalgamation. The Maria Clara ensemble, combining indigenous and European elements, became a symbol of Filipino identity and modesty. This sartorial shift mirrored the broader cultural changes and the blending of traditions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rise of the Chinese Mestizo Class:</strong>  
      Economic opportunities in trade and agriculture led to the emergence of a prosperous Chinese mestizo class. Their wealth enabled them to access education and participate in the reformist movements, further influencing the cultural landscape of the Philippines.
