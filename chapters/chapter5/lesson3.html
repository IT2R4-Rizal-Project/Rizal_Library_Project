                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>A Philippine national symbol will be considered official once it is declared through a law or a proclamation. 
 	            The carabao, mango, and anahaw are widely known as national symbols, but they have no laws recognizing them as official national symbols. 
            	According to historical experts, Jose Rizal, who is widely considered a national hero, has not been officially declared a national hero in any existing Philippine law. 
 	            On the other hand, a National Artist of the Philippines is a rank or title given to Filipino citizens in recognition of their contributions to Philippine arts and letters. 
            	Still, they are not considered national symbols representing traditions and ideals.</p>
                <p>During the Commonwealth Era in 1934, Governor-General Frank Murphy declared sampaguita and narra as the national flower and national tree, respectively, through Proclamation No. 652. 
            	Philippine President Fidel Ramos declared the Philippine eagle as the national bird in 1995 through Proclamation No. 615, and the South Sea Pearl or Philippine Pearl as the national gem in 1996 through Proclamation No. 905. 
            	In 2009, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared arnis as the national sport and martial art through Republic Act 9850.</p>
                <p>In February 2013, the Philippine Senate passed a bill declaring waling-waling as the national flower alongside sampaguita. 
            	A similar bill in the House of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. 
            	However, President Benigno Aquino III vetoed the bill, leaving the waling-waling as an unofficial national symbol.</p>

                    <li><strong>No official declaration of national heroes:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- According to NHCP Section Chief Teodoro Atienza and historian Ambeth Ocampo, no Filipino historical figure has been officially declared a national hero through law or executive order.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Jose Rizal's status: </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Jose Rizal is mentioned as a national hero in the “whereas” clause of the Rizal Law (1956), but not in the main provisions of the law.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>1995 National Heroes Committee recommendation: </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- The <strong>Technical Committee</strong> recommended <strong>nine historical figures</strong> to be declared national heroes.</li>
                            <li>- No official action was taken on this recommendation until it was revisited in the <strong>14th Congress (2009). </strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Corazon Aquino's posthumous recognition efforts (2009): </strong>

                            <li>- After her death, <strong>Congresswoman Liwayway Vinzons-Chato</strong> filed a resolution to declare Corazon Aquino a national hero.</li>

                            <li>- On <strong>August 10, 2009</strong>, she urged Congress to recognize:</li>

 	     	                    </ul>
                            <li><strong>Congressman Salvador Escudero</strong> responded, saying heroes are shaped by people’s hearts, not legislation</li>
                            <li>The speech was referred to the <strong>Committee on Basic Education and Culture</strong>, but no further action was taken.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Rizal's Legacy in Modern Philippines</h3>
                <p>How Rizal continues to influence Philippine society:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the debate surrounding Rizal's status as a national hero?
                        <ul>
                            
                            <li><strong>Debate on Rizal's status as national hero:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>- Ongoing debate on whether Dr. Jose Rizal truly deserves the title of national hero.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Argument 1 – Rizal did not lead a revolution:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>- Critics argue that Rizal never led an armed resistance or revolution.</li>
                                    <li>- National heroes should be those who fought and died for the country's freedom, like Andres Bonifacio and Katipunan leaders.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Argument 2 – Rizal was a "made-to-order" hero:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>- Some claim Rizal was promoted by the American colonial government, especially by Governor Howard Taft (Ocampo, 1990).</li>
                                    <li>- Americans favored Rizal because he did not oppose American colonization.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Argument 3 – Rizal supported American colonization:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>- In writings like “Letter to the Women of Malolos” and “Filipinas Dentro de Cien Años”, Rizal appeared to:</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>- Have high hopes for American colonization.</li>
                                            <li>- Believe it would bring freedom and progress to the Philippines.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Rizal’s Silence Does Not Mean Support
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Historian <strong>Ambeth R. Ocampo (1990)</strong> clarified that Rizal's silence on American colonialism does not imply support for it.</li>
                            <li>- Rizal did not speak against American rule because he died before the Americans fully established control in the Philippines.</li>
                            <li>- Rizal had no clear knowledge of how American rule would unfold.</li>
                            <li>- He was a pragmatist who believed in working within the system to achieve reforms.</li>
                            <li>- Rizal may have seen the Americans as potential allies against Spanish corruption and abuse, but not necessarily as legitimate colonizers.</li>
                            <li>- Ocampo emphasized that Rizal’s heroism was rooted in his excellence, integrity, and patriotism, not just his martyrdom.</li>
                            <li>- Rizal was a visionary who believed in the potential of the Philippines to become a free and independent nation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h3>Becoming a National Hero</h3>
                <p>Factors that contribute to Rizal's status as a national symbol:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Act No. 137 (1900)

                            <li>SThis marked the start of officially recognizing Filipino heroes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Ways of Honoring Heroes

                        </ul>

                            <li>Tasked with evaluating and recommending historical figures as national heroes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        </ul>
