                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>José Rizal's articles played a crucial role in shaping Philippine nationalism and social consciousness during the Spanish colonial period. This lesson examines three of his most significant articles that had a profound impact on Philippine society and the reform movement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>"The Philippines a Century Hence" (1889)</h3>
                <p>Jose Rizal’s essay "Filipinas Dentro de Cien Años" predicted the future of the Philippines under continued Spanish rule. Published in La Solidaridad, it reflected on the country’s rich past, its economic decline, and the suffering of Filipinos. </p>
                <p>Rizal warned Spain of a possible revolution, drawing parallels to the French Revolution. His goal was to awaken Filipino nationalism and urge the people to fight for their rights.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>"Causes of Misery"</h3>
                <p>Causes of Misery in The Philippines a Century Hence
                    Rizal identified three main causes of Filipino suffering under Spanish rule:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><u><strong>Spain’s military laws</strong></u> – Militarization led to depopulation, poverty, abandoned farms, and weakened family life.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Destruction of native culture</strong></u> – Spanish colonization erased Filipino heritage, causing a loss of identity, pride, and hope for the future.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Passive submission</strong></u> – The friars’ misuse of power and religion bred fear, silence, and submission among Filipinos.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>"Rizal’s Optimism"</h3>
                <p>In The Philippines a Century Hence, Rizal questioned whether Spain truly had the power to stop the Philippines from progressing. Despite the oppression and decline brought by colonial rule, he remained hopeful for the country’s future. He offered several reasons for this optimism:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><u><strong>Education and Awareness</strong></u> – Spain’s attempt to keep Filipinos ignorant failed. National consciousness grew, and intelligent Filipino leaders still emerged.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Poverty as a Catalyst</strong></u> – Instead of weakening them, poverty pushed Filipinos to seek reform and pursue progress.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Failed Suppression</strong></u> – destroy the Filipino people through war and famine were unsuccessful. The population endured and even grew, and Spain was unwilling to sacrifice countless soldiers for total control.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rizal believed that Spain could not stop Philippine progress and that change was only possible through major reforms in its colonial policies to match the rising nationalism among Filipinos.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>"Rizal’s Forecast"</h3>
                <p>In his essay, Rizal questioned whether the Philippines would remain a Spanish colony in the future. He acknowledged that Spain had maintained control for 300 years because Filipinos had been loyal, sacrificing their freedom due to the promises and friendship offered by Spain.</p>
                <p>Rizal predicted that if this situation continued, the Filipino people would eventually rise up, leading to a revolution unless Spain reformed. He outlined two key demands from the Filipinos:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Representation in the Spanish Cortes and the ability to address grievances.</em></li>
                    <li><em>The right to human rights and freedoms.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rizal suggested that fulfilling these demands would allow the Philippines to remain a colony but with more freedom and legal protections. However, if ignored, the Filipinos would seek independence. He clarified that his hope was for greater freedom, not complete separation, and advocated for peaceful negotiations with Spain to achieve this.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>"Other Related Writings"</h3>
                <p>Aside from The Philippines: A Century Hence, Rizal wrote several influential works that ignited Filipino patriotism and contributed to the Philippine revolution. This chapter will focus on two key writings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Letter to the Young Women of Malolos</em></li>
                    <li><em>Sobre La Indolencia De Los Filipinos (The Indolence of the Filipinos)</em></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>"The Indolence of the Filipinos"</h3>
                <p>In this essay published in La Solidaridad (in five parts between July and September 1890), Jose Rizal refuted the Spanish claim that Filipinos were naturally lazy. He argued that Filipino “indolence” was a result of Spanish colonization, not an inherent trait. Rizal emphasized that Filipinos were once hardworking and industrious before colonial rule disrupted their way of life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>"Key Causes of “Indolence” According to Rizal:"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><u><strong>Galleon Trade</strong></u> – Cut off the Philippines from trade with nearby countries, killing local businesses and industries.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Forced Labor</strong></u> – Filipinos were taken from their work to serve in war-related and public projects, abandoning farming and trade.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Lack of Protection</strong></u> – Constant threats from pirates and invaders led to destroyed communities and a nomadic lifestyle.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Poor Education System</strong> – Schools lacked practical subjects like agriculture and industry, offering only repetitive religious instruction.</u></li>
                    <li><u><strong>Bad Example from Spaniards</strong></u> – Colonial officials and elites avoided manual labor and were idle, influencing the natives.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Gambling Culture</strong></u> – Cockfighting and betting, encouraged even by friars and officials, distracted the people from productive work.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Corrupt Religious Teachings</strong></u> – Friars taught that poverty led to heaven, discouraging hard work.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Heavy Taxes and Exploitation</strong></u> – Excessive taxation and abuses drained people’s earnings, killing motivation to work.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>"Letter to the Young Women of Malolos"</h3>
                <p>Jose Rizal wrote this letter in response to Marcelo H. del Pilar’s request, praising the courage of 20 young women from Malolos, Bulacan, who sought to open a school to learn Spanish despite opposition from a Spanish priest. In this letter, Rizal advocated for women’s right to education and emphasized their vital role in shaping a strong, moral, and patriotic society.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h3>"Key Points Rizal Emphasized:"</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><u><strong>Support for Equal Education</strong></u> – Rizal believed women deserved the same educational opportunities as men, challenging the traditional view that women belonged only in domestic roles.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Critique of the Clergy</strong></u> – He condemned local priests for not representing true Christian values.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Encouragement of Critical Thinking</strong></u> – People, including women, should think for themselves and not blindly follow authority.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Role of Mothers</strong> – Mothers should teach their children love for God, country, and fellowmen, and instill strong values.</u></li>
                    <li><u><strong>Influence on Society</strong></u> – Women, especially mothers, should help build a better nation by raising good citizens and setting moral standards.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Qualities of Ideal Women</strong></u> – Filipino women should be noble, dignified, and strong, yet also loving and gentle.</li>
                    <li><u><strong>Self-Education and Moral Living</strong></u> – Young women should pursue education, live with good values, and choose life partners wisely.</li>
                </ul>
