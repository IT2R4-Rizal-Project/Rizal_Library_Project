                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In late 1884, Dr. Jose Rizal began writing a novel in Madrid and completed about half of it. He continued writing in Paris after finishing his studies and completed half of the second half. The remaining portion was written in Germany.</p>
                <p>During a difficult time in December 1886, penniless and hopeless, Rizal almost burned the manuscript. Fortunately, a telegram from his friend Dr. Maximo Viola, announcing a visit to Berlin, renewed Rizal's hope. Eventually, Viola, who came from a wealthy family, helped with the funds needed to publish the Noli Me Tangere.</p>

                    <h3>Synopsis of the Noli Me Tangere</h3>
                <p>The novel had 63 chapters and an epilogue. It started with a reception hosted by Capitan Tiago (Santiago de los Santos) at his house on Calle Anilao on the last day of October. The reception was held to honor Crisostomo Ibarra, a young and wealthy Filipino who had recently returned after studying in Europe for seven years. Ibarra, the only son of Don Rafael Ibarra and a friend of Capitan Tiago was engaged to the beautiful Maria Clara, who was believed to be Capitan Tiago's daughter.</p>
                <p>The notable guests during the reception were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Padre Damaso, a Franciscan friar who had served as the parish priest for two decades of San Diego, Ibarra's hometown.</li>
                    <li>Padre Sibyla, a young Dominican parish priest from Binondo</li>
                    <li>Senor Guevara, a kind and elderly lieutenant of the Guardia Civil</li>
                    <li>Don Tiburcio de Espanada, a deceitful Spanish physician and controlled by his wife</li>
                    <li>Dona Victorina, the domineering wife of Don Tiburcio</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Crisostomo Ibarra arrived and impressed the guests, except for Padre Damaso. He introduced himself to the ladies and discussed his studies and travels during dinner. Padre Damaso, unhappy with his meal, tried to discredit Ibarra. After dinner, Ibarra left for his hotel but was told by Lieutenant Guevara about his father's tragic death. Don Rafael defended a boy and accidentally caused his own demise. He was imprisoned, died unhappily, and was buried in an accused-of-heresy incident. Ibarra, grateful to Lieutenant Guevara, vowed to uncover the truth about his father's death.</p>
                <p>The next day, Ibarra met Maria Clara and assured her that he hadn't forgotten her. After their reunion, he visited his father's grave in San Diego. The grave-digger revealed that the previous parish priest ordered Don Rafael's corpse to be thrown into the lake due to bad weather. Angry, Ibarra left the cemetery and encountered Padre Salvi, who claimed innocence since he wasn't the parish priest during the incident. It was Padre Damaso, his predecessor, who was responsible. Convinced of Padre Salvi's innocence, Ibarra left.</p>
                <p>Around town, Ibarra also encountered various interesting individuals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tasio the Sage was an old and wise man with progressive ideas, but people called him "Tasio the Lunatic" simply because they were unable to grasp his ideas.</li>
                    <li>A progressive school teacher who expressed concerns about the lack of a proper school building and the discouraging attitude of the parish priest towards modern teaching methods.</li>
                    <li>The gobernadorcillo who was spineless and catered to the Spanish parish priest's wishes.</li>
                    <li>Don Felipe Lino who led the liberal faction and held the position of teniente mayor.</li>
                    <li>Don Melchor served as the captain of the town police.</li>
                    <li>Don Basilio and Don Valentin, the respected former gobernadorcillos.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>One tragic tale in the novel involves Sisa. The novel portrays her descent from wealth to poverty after marrying a gambler. Her life turned miserable when she lost her only joys, her two sons. Basilio and Crispin worked as sacristans in San Diego church to support their mother. Sadly, Crispin was falsely accused of theft by the cruel sacristan mayor. He was then tortured to death. Basilio managed to escape but was deeply affected by his brother's cries. Overwhelmed by the loss of her sons, Sisa desperately searched for them everywhere. Ultimately, Sisa succumbed to madness due to her immense sorrow.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Capitan Tiago, Maria Clara, and Aunt Isabel, who cared for Maria Clara after her mother's passing, arrived in San Diego. Ibarra organized a picnic by the lake, attended by Maria Clara and her friends Sinang, Victoria, Iday, and Neneng. Aunt Isabel, Capitana Tika (Sinang's mother), Andeng (Maria Clara's foster sister), Albino (who loved Sinang), Ibarra, and his friends also joined. A notable boatman named Elias, a strong and quiet peasant youth, was present.</p>
                <p>At the request of her friends, Maria Clara played the harp and sang "The Song of Maria Clara," a poem rendered as a song that celebrates the beauty of one's homeland. It emphasized family love and belonging. The music also touches on the mixed emotions of death in one's native land, where the absence of loved ones is keenly felt.</p>
                <p>While having a pleasant picnic time, an incident occurred. A crocodile happened on the group's picnic area. Elias trapped and fought the crocodile bravely, but he was unable to overpower it. Ibarra jumped in, killed the crocodile, and rescued Elias.</p>
                <p>After the incident, the group joined Padre Salvi, Capitan Basilio (former gobernadorcillo and Sinang's father), the alferez (lieutenant of the Guardia Civil), and the town officials for lunch. During the meal, Maria Clara and her friends played the "Wheel of Chance." However, Padre Salvi destroyed the fortune-telling book, saying it was sinful. Later, soldiers from the Guardia Civil arrived looking for Elias. He was accused of assaulting Padre Damaso and the alferez. Fortunately, Elias had already left.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Ibarra received a telegram approving his donation of a schoolhouse for the children of San Diego. The next day, Ibarra consulted Tasio about the schoolhouse project. Tasio's writings were in hieroglyphics, which he explained were meant for future generations to recognize that not everyone ignored history. Tasio was pessimistic about the schoolhouse project.</p>
                <p>He insisted that Ibarra's plans to build a school would only be scorned unless he gained the church's and influential leaders' approval. Nevertheless, Ibarra went on with the project.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, San Diego was busy preparing for its annual fiesta honoring San Diego de Alcala. Visitors brought music, fireworks, feasting, and traditional dances. Five brass bands, including the famous Pagsanjan Band, owned by Miguel Guevara, and three orchestras provided lively tunes for the festivities.</p>

                <p>During the fiesta morning, a high Mass was held in the church, led by Padre Salvi. However, it was Padre Damaso who delivered a sermon. He lengthily lectured on the supposed negative influence of educated individuals who, in his view, spread harmful ideas among the people.</p>
                <p>As Padre Salvi continued the mass, Elias discreetly approached Ibarra, who was praying beside Maria Clara. He cautioned Ibarra to be careful during the upcoming ceremony to lay the schoolhouse's cornerstone. Elias revealed that there was a plot to assassinate Ibarra.</p>
                <p>Elias suspected a man described as 'yellowish' working for Ibarra's enemies. During the cornerstone ceremony, the derrick collapsed, but Elias saved Ibarra's life by pushing him aside. It was the yellowish man who died in the accident.</p>
                <p>During dinner, another incident occurred. Padre Damaso insulted Ibarra's father, leading to a heated confrontation. Ibarra reacted by punching Padre Damaso and grabbing a knife. Fortunately, Maria Clara intervened, preventing further harm.</p>
                <p>Ibarra's attack on Padre Damaso led to two outcomes: his engagement to Maria Clara was canceled, and he was excommunicated.</p>
                <p>Luckily, the governor-general, who was tolerant, visited the town and befriended Ibarra. He reassured him, convinced Capitan Tiago to accept Ibarra, and vowed to help lift the ex-communication with the Archbishop of Manila.</p>
                <p>After the fiesta, Maria Clara fell ill and received treatment from the unqualified Spanish physician Tiburcio de Espanada. Tiburcio's wife, Victorina, a vain and frustrated native woman, often visited Capitan Tiago's house. Despite being of native descent, Victorina considered her people inferior and desired to be more Spanish, adopting the name "Doctora Dona Victorina de los Reyes de Espanada." She introduced a young Spaniard named Don Alfonso Linares de Espanada, who was jobless and seeking a wealthy Filipino bride. Both Victorina and Padre Damaso supported his pursuit of Maria Clara, but she remained unresponsive due to her love for Ibarra.</p>
                <p>The novel also had a touch of comedy. The humor was about a fight between two ridiculous women: Dona Consolacion, the crude mistress of the Spanish alferez, and Dona Victorina, a native woman who wanted to be more Spanish and the wife of the submissive Spanish quack doctor. The two women exchanged insults using vulgar language and even attempted to fight each other physically. However, their brawl was interrupted by the timely arrival of Padre Salvi, disappointing the curious spectators.</p>
                <p>Elias shared a tragic story with Ibarra, paralleling Sisa's tale. His grandfather, a young bookkeeper, was falsely accused of arson and suffered public flogging, leaving him crippled. To support her sick husband and son, his pregnant wife turned to begging and eventually became a prostitute. After the death of her husband and the birth of their second child, she fled to the mountains with her two sons.</p>
                <p>Years later, Elias' grandmother's first son, Balat, became a notorious criminal who caused fear in the provinces. After being captured by the authorities, his severed head was hung on a tree branch in the forest. Tragically witnessing this horrific scene led to Elias' grandmother's death.</p>
                <p>Balat's kind-hearted younger brother ran away and became a trusted laborer for a wealthy man in Tayabas. He fell in love with the man's daughter, but her father discovered the truth and sent him to jail. The girl gave birth to twins, Elias, and a girl, raised as rich children by their grandfather. Elias attended a Jesuit College while his sister studied at La Concordia College. However, a distant relative exposed their scandalous birth during a money dispute, causing them to be disgraced. An old male servant, who they had mistreated, was forced to testify in court and revealed he was their real father.</p>
                <p>Elias and his sister left Tayabas to escape their shameful past. Unfortunately, one day the sister vanished, leaving Elias distraught. He searched relentlessly but eventually heard that a girl resembling his sister had been found dead on San Diego Beach. From that point on, Elias lived as a wanderer, moving from one province to another, until he crossed paths with Ibarra.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Ibarra's enemies plotted to ruin him. They staged an attack on the Guardia Civil barracks. Ibarra was falsely blamed as the mastermind. When the attack failed and the attackers were caught, Ibarra was held accountable for the incident. </p>
                <p>Elias protected Ibarra by destroying incriminating papers and setting his house on fire. He joined Ibarra in prison and helped him escape. They escaped on a boat loaded with grass. Ibarra visited Capitan Tiago's house to say goodbye to Maria Clara. In their emotional meeting, Ibarra forgave Maria Clara for giving his letters to the authorities. Maria Clara revealed that the letters were switched with one from her late mother, Pia Alba, given by Padre Salvi. This letter exposed Padre Damaso as her real father.</p>
                <p> Ibarra and Elias paddled up the river after saying goodbye to Maria Clara. The Guardia Civil pursued them on a police boat as they reached the lake. Elias told Ibarra to hide while he distracted the soldiers by swimming to the shore. The police fired at Elias. He was hit, and there was a pool of red in the water, but the authorities did not find the body. They assumed it was Ibarra who died. This diversion helped Ibarra escape and fled to Manila.</p>
                <p>Critically wounded, Elias reached the shore and encountered Basilio, a young boy grieving over his mother Sisa's body. Elias instructed Basilio to build a funeral pyre to cremate their bodies. It was Christmas Eve, with the moon shining gently in the sky. Basilio prepared the pyre. While Elias felt his life slipping away, he faced east, whispering his final words. He expressed regret for not witnessing the dawn brighten over his homeland. He urged those who would see it to welcome the dawn and remember those who had fallen during the night.</p> 
                <p> In the novel's epilogue, the fates of the remaining characters are revealed: Maria Clara, remaining loyal to the memory of Ibarra, the man she truly loved, entered the Santa Clara nunnery. Padre Salvi left his position in the San Diego parish and became a chaplain at the nunnery. Padre Damaso was transferred to a distant province, but the following morning he was discovered dead in his bedroom. Capitan Tiago, once a hospitable host and generous supporter of the church, became a ruined man addicted to opium.</p>
                <p>Dona Victorina, continuing to dominate her husband Don Tiburcio, began wearing eyeglasses due to declining eyesight. Linares, who failed to win Maria Clara's affection, succumbed to dysentery and was laid to rest in Paco cemetery. The alferez, who managed to fend off the failed attack on the barracks, was promoted to the rank of major. He then left for Spain, abandoning his poor mistress, Dona Consolacion.</p>
                <p>The novel ends with Maria Clara residing in the Santa Clara nunnery. She was described as an unhappy nun isolated from the outside world forever.</p>
