                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In late 1884, Dr. Jose Rizal began writing a novel in Madrid and completed about half of it. He continued writing in Paris after finishing his studies and completed half of the second half. The remaining portion was written in Germany.</p>
                <p>During a difficult time in December 1886, penniless and hopeless, Rizal almost burned the manuscript. Fortunately, a telegram from his friend Dr. Maximo Viola, announcing a visit to Berlin, renewed Rizal's hope. Eventually, Viola, who came from a wealthy family, helped with the funds needed to publish the Noli Me Tangere.</p>
