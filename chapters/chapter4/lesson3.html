                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>"El Filibusterismo," or "The Reign of Greed," is the second novel by Jose Rizal and is considered a masterpiece of Philippine literature. It was published on September 18, 1891, in Ghent, Belgium. It is a sequel to Noli Me Tangere.</p>
                <p>Rizal began writing El Filibusterismo in October 1887 in Calamba, Laguna, and completed the book three years after on March 29, 1891, in Biarritz. The novel was dedicated to the three martyred priests, Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora.</p>
                <p>The title "El Filibusterismo" has undergone multiple changes in meaning. According to Blumentritt, "filibusterismo" refers to the concept of the colony separating from the mother country, and "filibusteros" are individuals who desire to achieve this idea.</p>
                <p>Rizal started writing El Filibusterismo during his first homecoming against the threats and oppressions he and his family suffered because of the Noli and the so-called Calamba agrarian trouble.</p>
                <p>As Rizal's usual situation abroad, having insufficient money for his needs, he ran out of funds to print the book. Another friend, Valentin Ventura, helped Rizal with the much-needed assistance to finish the book's publication.</p>
                <p>Almost all of the first edition copies of El Filibusterismo, Ghent edition, were put in wooden boxes and sent to Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the boxes were seized, and the books were lost. As a result, the book became rare, and the few remaining Ghent copies fetched very high prices.</p>

                <h3>Symbolisms in the El Filibusterismo Cover</h3>
                <p>The cover of El Filibusterismo contains various symbolisms that reflect the novel's themes and the social conditions during Rizal’s time. Here are some of the symbolisms found in the book cover design:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Silhouette of a Filipina: believed to be Maria Clara or "Inang Bayan," to whom Rizal dictates the novel.</li>
                    <li>Cross/Crucifix: represents the Catholic faith as it rises above Inang Bayan and Filipinos, showing dominance; also symbolizes sufferings and death.</li>
                    <li>Pomelo Blossoms and Laurel Leaves: represent faith, honor, and fidelity—values Rizal aspires for Filipinos to embody; pomelos scent the air during prayers, and laurel leaves are crowns used in Greek Olympics.</li>
                    <li>Burning Torch: refers to the Olympic torch, awakening Filipino consciousness, and shedding light on the manuscript.</li>
                    <li>Sunflower: symbolizes a new beginning and happiness, though appearing as if bowing down.</li>
                    <li>Feet: symbolize the power of the friars; placed at the base of the triangle since without friars Filipinos cannot stand on their own.</li>
                    <li>Shoes: represent wealth and the footprints left by friars in teaching Catholicism.</li>
                    <li>Hairy Legs: symbolize the Legend of the Wolf, showing how friars hide their true nature and character through shape-shifting.</li>
                    <li>Helmet of a Guardia Civil: represents the arrogance of those in authority.</li>
                    <li>Whip: symbolizes the abuses and cruelties done by Spaniards and friars as depicted in the novel.</li>
                    <li>Flogs (Suplina): used for self-flagellation, symbolizing the cruelties of the Guardia Civil like the whip.</li>
                    <li>Chain: symbolizes slavery and imprisonment.</li>
                    <li>Bamboo Stalks: represent Filipino resiliency.</li>

                <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
                <p>El Filibusterismo begins thirteen years after the events of Noli Me Tangere. Crisóstomo Ibarra, presumed dead, returns under the identity of Simoun, a wealthy and influential jeweler who gains the trust of the Spanish colonial elite. Unlike the idealistic reformer he once was, Simoun now seeks vengeance against the oppressive regime that destroyed his dreams and personal life.</p>
                <p>Using his wealth and connections, Simoun secretly supports rebellion and corruption to destabilize the government from within. He manipulates the powerful, encourages abuses, and arms those oppressed. At the same time, he attempts to orchestrate a massive explosion during a high-profile wedding, which would serve as the spark for a full-scale revolution. This plan, however, is thwarted when Isagani, a young student and former fiancé of the bride, throws the explosive lamp into the river to save innocent lives.</p>
                <p>The failure of the uprising and betrayal from people he thought he could trust force Simoun into hiding. Gravely wounded and disillusioned, he seeks refuge in the home of Padre Florentino, a priest who offers him a chance at redemption. In his final moments, Simoun confesses and realizes that true change cannot be achieved through hatred and violence.</p>
                <p>The novel ends with Padre Florentino throwing Simoun's treasure chest into the sea, symbolizing the rejection of material wealth as a means of achieving justice. Through its tragic tone and powerful conclusion, <em>El Filibusterismo</em> reveals the moral and spiritual consequences of revenge, and questions whether violent revolution is the right path toward societal reform.</p>
