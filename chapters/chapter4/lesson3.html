                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>"El Filibusterismo," or "The Reign of Greed," is the second novel by Jose Rizal and is considered a masterpiece of Philippine literature. It was published on September 18, 1891, in Ghent, Belgium. It is a sequel to Noli Me Tangere.</p>
                <p>Rizal began writing El Filibusterismo in October 1887 in Calamba, Laguna, and completed the book three years after on March 29, 1891, in Biarritz. The novel was dedicated to the three martyred priests, Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora.</p>
                <p>The title "El Filibusterismo" has undergone multiple changes in meaning. According to Blumentritt, "filibusterismo" refers to the concept of the colony separating from the mother country, and "filibusteros" are individuals who desire to achieve this idea.</p>
                <p>Rizal started writing El Filibusterismo during his first homecoming against the threats and oppressions he and his family suffered because of the Noli and the so-called Calamba agrarian trouble.</p>
                <p>As Rizal's usual situation abroad, having insufficient money for his needs, he ran out of funds to print the book. Another friend, Valentin Ventura, helped Rizal with the much-needed assistance to finish the book's publication.</p>
                <p>Almost all of the first edition copies of El Filibusterismo, Ghent edition, were put in wooden boxes and sent to Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the boxes were seized, and the books were lost. As a result, the book became rare, and the few remaining Ghent copies fetched very high prices.</p>

                <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
                <p>El Filibusterismo begins thirteen years after the events of Noli Me Tangere. Crisóstomo Ibarra, presumed dead, returns under the identity of Simoun, a wealthy and influential jeweler who gains the trust of the Spanish colonial elite. Unlike the idealistic reformer he once was, Simoun now seeks vengeance against the oppressive regime that destroyed his dreams and personal life.</p>
                <p>Using his wealth and connections, Simoun secretly supports rebellion and corruption to destabilize the government from within. He manipulates the powerful, encourages abuses, and arms those oppressed. At the same time, he attempts to orchestrate a massive explosion during a high-profile wedding, which would ignite an uprising.</p>
                <p>However, his plan is thwarted by Isagani, who throws the explosive lamp into the river to save lives. Simoun escapes but is wounded. He eventually seeks refuge with Padre Florentino, where he confesses his plans and failures. Before dying, he entrusts his treasure to the sea, hoping that it may one day serve a truly noble cause.</p>
