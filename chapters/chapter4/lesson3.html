            <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
            <p>El Filibusterismo begins thirteen years after the events of Noli Me Tangere. Crisóstomo Ibarra, presumed dead, returns under the identity of Simoun, a wealthy and influential jeweler who gains the trust of the Spanish colonial elite. Unlike the idealistic reformer he once was, Simoun now seeks vengeance against the oppressive regime that destroyed his dreams and personal life.</p>
            <p>Using his wealth and connections, Simoun secretly supports rebellion and corruption to destabilize the government from within. He manipulates the powerful, encourages abuses, and arms those oppressed. At the same time, he attempts to orchestrate a massive explosion during a high-profile wedding, which would serve as the spark for a full-scale revolution. This plan, however, is thwarted when Isagani, a young student and former fiancé of the bride, throws the explosive lamp into the river to save innocent lives.</p>
            <p>The failure of the uprising and betrayal from people he thought he could trust force Simoun into hiding. Gravely wounded and disillusioned, he seeks refuge in the home of Padre Florentino, a priest who offers him a chance at redemption. In his final moments, Simoun confesses and realizes that true change cannot be achieved through hatred and violence.</p>
            <p>The novel ends with Padre Florentino throwing Simoun's treasure chest into the sea, symbolizing the rejection of material wealth as a means of achieving justice. Through its tragic tone and powerful conclusion, *El Filibusterismo* reveals the moral and spiritual consequences of revenge, and questions whether violent revolution is the right path toward societal reform.</p>
