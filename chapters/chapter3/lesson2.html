                <h3>The Trial</h3>
                <h3>The Prosecution's Case</h3>
            <h4>Key Evidence Against Rizal:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Letter from Antonio Luna to Mariano Ponce proving Rizal helped organize La Solidaridad.</li>
                    <li>Letter from Rizal to his sister (1890) mentioning the Illustrados' exile and its impact.</li>
                    <li>A poem, "Kundiman," calling for liberty, falsely attributed to Rizal.</li>
                    <li>A Masonic document supporting revolutionary ideals.</li>
                    <li>Letter from Rizal (1892) about preparing a safe refuge in Borneo.</li>
                    <li>Speech by Emilio Jacinto mentioning Rizal in a revolutionary context.</li>
                    <li>Poem "Hymn to Talisay" written by Rizal for his students, seen as inspiring rebellion.</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h4>Weak Testimonies Against Rizal</h4>
                <p>Some documents and testimonies were weak or unreliable. 
                Pio Valenzuela stated that Rizal was against the revolution. Other witnesses falsely claimed Rizal was angry about the revolution or planned an escape.</p>
                
            <h4>Formal Charges Against Rizal</h4>
                <p>On December 11, 1896, Rizal was formally charged. He was accused of being the leader of the Philippine Revolution. 
                Authorities claimed he founded secret societies and spread revolutionary propaganda.</p>
                
            <h4>Rizal's Defense</h4>
                <p>On December 15, 1896, Rizal wrote a manifesto. He denied involvement in the revolution. 
                He encouraged Filipinos to focus on education, industry, and peaceful reforms instead of armed rebellion.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>The "Kangaroo Trial"</h3>
                <p>On December 26, 1896, José Rizal was taken under heavy guard to Cuartel de España, where he faced a military trial. The trial was led by Lt. 
                Col. José Togores Arjona, and several Spanish military officers were present, including Captains Ricardo Muñoz Arias, Manuel Reguera, Santiago Izquierdo Osorio, and Manuel Díaz Becerra.</p>
                
                <p>The courtroom was filled with Spanish officials and spectators, including the prosecuting attorney, Capt. 
                Rafael Domínguez, and Judge Advocate Colonel Francisco Olive, who had previously handled Rizal's preliminary investigation. </p>

                <p>Rizal was not given the right to choose his own lawyer and was instead assigned a Spanish military officer, Lt. Luis Taviel de Andrade, as his defense attorney. 
                This was a bitter irony, as Taviel de Andrade was the brother of Rizal's former bodyguard during his peaceful exile in Dapitan. 
                The defense attorney reviewed the charges and recognized that Rizal was already being treated as guilty before the trial even began. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Rizal's Defense - The 12 Points of Innocence</h3>
                <p>Despite the unfair circumstances, Rizal courageously defended himself with 12 key arguments proving his innocence:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Pío Valenzuela testified that Rizal was against rebellion and preferred peaceful reforms.</li>
                    <li>2. He never wrote a letter supporting or endorsing the Katipunan.</li>
                    <li>3. He was not a member of the Katipunan and never took part in its plans.</li>
                    <li>4. If he were guilty, he would not have returned from his exile in Dapitan.</li>
                    <li>5. The revolutionaries never consulted him regarding their plans. </li>
                    <li>6. His organization, the Liga Filipina, aimed for peaceful reforms, not rebellion.</li>
                    <li>7. The Liga Filipina failed shortly after its creation, proving it was not a revolutionary movement.</li>
                    <li>8. He never had a revolutionary agenda when he founded the Liga Filipina.</li>
                    <li>9. Spanish authorities had misinterpreted his personal letters.</li>
                    <li>10. He never owned properties related to the revolution or rebellion.</li>
                    <li>11. His educational and medical work in the Philippines showed his true intentions of helping Filipinos.</li>
                    <li>12. There was no solid evidence linking him directly to the uprising.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Biased Verdict & Death Sentence</h3>
            <p>Despite Rizal's well-argued defense, the Spanish military court ignored all evidence of his innocence. The judges, who were biased against him from the start, found him guilty of rebellion and sedition. 
            The verdict was quickly sent to Governor-General Camilo de Polavieja, who was determined to make an example of Rizal. Without hesitation, he confirmed the death sentence and scheduled the execution.</p>
            <p>On December 28, 1896, Governor-General Polavieja officially signed the order for Rizal's execution by firing squad. The execution was set for the morning of December 30, 1896, at Bagumbayan (now known as Luneta Park in Manila). 
            Despite public outcry and last-minute appeals for clemency, Rizal's fate was sealed. His trial, widely considered unjust and politically motivated, became one of the most infamous moments in Philippine history.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Rizal's Last Hours</h3>
            <h4>Alone in the Cell</h4>
            <p>After being sentenced to death on December 30, 1896, Rizal calmly accepted his fate. 
            On the morning of December 29, he received official notice of his execution. He was then moved to the prison chapel, where he spent his final hours.</p>
            <p>Rizal wrote farewell letters to his loved ones, conversed with his closest friends, and received many visitors. 
            Between noon and 3:00 PM, he was left alone in his cell. He ate his last meal and wrote his final letter to his best friend, Ferdinand Blumentritt, expressing his peaceful acceptance of his fate.</p>

            <p>Before being sentenced to death, Rizal spent his final days preparing himself for the inevitable. Family and friends visited him, but it was in solitude that Rizal wrote his final masterpiece, Mi Ultimo Adios (My Last Farewell). </p>
            <p> Rizal's family defied orders and visited him before his execution. His sisters refused to let the Spaniards take his body and fought for his dignity. Rizal distributed personal belongings to each family member, giving keepsakes like a watch, handkerchief, and a lamp containing his hidden last poem. 
            After his death, his sisters retrieved the lamp and discovered the poem Mi Último Adiós inside. The poem, which was secretly written during his imprisonment, became a powerful symbol of patriotism and sacrifice.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Rizal's Last Day</h3>
            <h4>Morning</h4>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>6:00 A.M</strong> Rizal was read with his death sentence and prepared for his final moments.</li>
            <li><strong>7:00 A.M</strong> He was moved to the prison chapel and visited by Jesuit priests and teachers from Ateneo.</li>
            <li><strong>8:00 A.M</strong> Rizal had his last breakfast with Fr. Antonio Rosell, after which his defense lawyer, Lt. Taviel de Andrade, visited him.</li>
            <li><strong>9:00 A.M</strong> Fr. Frederico Faura arrived, reminding Rizal of his prophecy that he would lose his head for writing Noli Me Tangere.</li>

        </ul> <br>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>12:00 P.M. - 3:30 P.M</strong> Rizal was left alone in his cell, where he continued writing his farewell poem, which he secretly hid in an alcohol cooking stove.</li>

        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Of Letters and Tears</h3>
            <p>On the evening of December 29, 1896, Rizal had his last meal and informed Captain Dominguez that he forgave those who had condemned him to death. 
            That same night, he signed a controversial retraction letter, renouncing the Philippine revolution and his association with the independence movement.
            Some historians argue that the letter was forged, while others believe it was genuine.</p> 
            <p>At 3:00 a.m. on December 30, Rizal prayed and confessed his sins in the chapel. He read Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis, a book he held dear. 
            At 5:30 a.m., he had his final breakfast of boiled eggs and sealed a small note inside an oil lamp, which contained Mi Último Adiós.
            This was his last literary masterpiece—a final message of love, sacrifice, and hope for his beloved country. </p>
            <p>At 6:00 a.m., he wrote his last letters to his family before marching to Bagumbayan, where he would face his execution with unwavering courage.</p>
        
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Final Farewells</h3>
            <p>In his final letters, Rizal expressed deep sorrow for the pain he had caused his family. In a note to his father, he apologized for the suffering brought by his imprisonment and execution. 
            To his mother, Teodora Alonso, he wrote a simple but heartbreaking farewell.</p> 
            <p>His letter to his brother reflected his sadness over leaving him alone to care for their family. He reassured his brother that he was innocent of the crime of rebellion and had already accepted his fate. 
            Despite the injustice he faced, Rizal forgave those responsible for his death.</p>
            <p>In a letter to his family, he urged them to forgive each other and live in harmony. He reminded them to love and respect their parents as he had always done. 
            His final request was simple: he wished to be buried with a cross and a stone, without grand ceremonies or anniversaries. His last words showed his enduring love for his country and his fiancée, Josephine Bracken.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>To Die Is To Rest</h3>
        <h4>The Execution</h4>
            <p>As the execution took place, the Spanish soldiers shouted, "Viva España! Muerte a los traidores!" ("Long live Spain! Death to the traitors!"), but the Filipino crowd remained silent, refusing to echo the cheers of their colonizers. 
            The silence that followed was more powerful than any words—an unspoken protest against the injustice of Rizal's death.</p> 
            <p>Rizal's final moments were not just the end of a man's life but the beginning of a revolution. His execution ignited a fire in the hearts of the Filipino people, strengthening their resolve to fight for independence. 
            The shot that ended his life was also the shot that would shatter Spain's grip on the Philippines</p>
            <p>Though the Spanish authorities had hoped that Rizal's death would put an end to the growing resistance, it had the opposite effect. 
            Instead of silencing the revolution, it became the catalyst that inspired Filipinos to continue the struggle for freedom. His martyrdom transformed him into a national symbol—proof that even in death, his ideals would live on.</p>
        
        <h4>Rizal's Enduring Legacy </h4>
            <p>In the years that followed, the Philippine Revolution gained momentum, and just two years after Rizal's execution, Spain's control over the country weakened. 
            By 1898, Spain had lost its rule over the Philippines, proving that Rizal's sacrifice was not in vain.</p> 
            <p>His death marked not just the tragic loss of a hero but also the birth of a nation that would continue to honor his legacy for generations to come. 
            Today, Rizal is remembered as the Philippines' national hero, and his martyrdom is commemorated every December 30 as Rizal Day.</p>
            <p>His works, including his novels, essays, and poems, continue to inspire Filipinos and people around the world. His life and death serve as a reminder of the power of intellect, courage, and self-sacrifice in the face of tyranny.</p>
