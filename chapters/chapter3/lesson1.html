                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In July 1892, Dr. José Rizal was exiled to Dapitan, Mindanao, by the Spanish authorities to silence his reformist and nationalist ideas. However, instead of allowing exile to defeat him, he turned Dapitan into a place of learning, service, and progress. Over the next four years (1892-1896), he dedicated himself to medicine, education, engineering, and community development, helping improve the lives of the locals. He also built a school, introduced modern agricultural techniques, and designed infrastructure projects. His time in Dapitan proved that true patriotism is not only about fighting for freedom but also about empowering people through knowledge and action, making this period one of the most inspiring chapters of his life.</p>

                <h3>CONDITIONS OF RIZAL’S EXILE</h3>
                <p>When José Rizal arrived in Dapitan, the Spanish authorities and a priest named Fr. Pablo Pastells offered to set him free if he took back his criticisms of the Spanish government and the Catholic Church. They also wanted him to follow religious practices and be loyal to Spain. However, Rizal refused because he believed that taking back his words would be a betrayal to his fellow Filipinos. Instead of giving in, he chose to stay in exile and focused on helping the people of Dapitan, showing his strong principles and love for his country.</p>
