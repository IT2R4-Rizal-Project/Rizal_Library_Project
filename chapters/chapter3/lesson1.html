                <h3>La Liga Filipina: Rizal's Peaceful Path to Reform</h3>
                <p>La Liga Filipina, founded by José Rizal on July 3, 1892, in Tondo, Manila, was a progressive civic organization with the goal of uniting Filipinos, promoting education, and pushing for reforms under Spanish rule. 
                The organization advocated for peaceful and legal means of achieving change, focusing on social justice, equality, and fair representation. 
                By empowering Filipinos through education and collective action, La Liga Filipina encouraged national development and worked within legal frameworks, striving for protection under the law without resorting to violence.
                </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Reform or Revolution: The Hidden Impact of La Liga Filipina</h3>
                <p>Although La Liga Filipina promoted peaceful reforms, the Spanish authorities saw it as a threat to colonial rule, fearing the potential for organized resistance. 
                As a result, some members of the Liga became disillusioned with peaceful means and began to believe that reform alone was insufficient. 
                This shift in perspective eventually led to the formation of more radical groups, most notably the Katipunan, a secret society that would later play a pivotal role in the Philippine Revolution.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Rizal's Arrest and the Dissolution of the Liga</h3>
                <p>Rizal was arrested on July 6, 1892, just days after establishing La Liga Filipina, and was exiled to Dapitan in Mindanao. Without his leadership, the Liga was dissolved, but its ideals—education, equality, and reform—continued to inspire the growing nationalist movement. 
                These principles lived on through the Katipunan, formed by former Liga members who adopted a more militant approach. This shift ultimately led the fight for Philippine independence. </p>
        </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Exile in Dapitan</h3>
                <p>When José Rizal arrived in Dapitan, the Spanish authorities and a priest named Fr. Pablo Pastells offered to set him free if he took back his criticisms of the Spanish government and the Catholic Church. 
                They also wanted him to follow religious practices and be loyal to Spain. However, Rizal refused because he believed that taking back his words would be a betrayal to his fellow Filipinos. 
                Instead of giving in, he chose to stay in exile and focused on helping the people of Dapitan, showing his strong principles and love for his country.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Rizal's Life Under Captain Carnicero</h3>
                <p>During his exile, Rizal lived at the residence of Captain Ricardo Carnicero, the politico-military governor of Dapitan. Unlike a typical prisoner, he was treated with respect and kindness. 
                This was due to Rizal's refusal to accept the strict religious conditions imposed by the Spanish clergy. Despite his exile, he was given the freedom to interact with the locals and continue his humanitarian work.</p>
                
                <p>Rizal and Captain Carnicero developed a close and respectful relationship. 
                Carnicero recognized Rizal's intelligence and good character, allowing him complete freedom to roam Dapitan and even ride his favorite horse. 
                He also gave positive reports about Rizal to Spanish authorities. In gratitude, Rizal wrote a poem, “A Don Ricardo Carnicero,” as a gift for the captain's birthday on August 26, 1892.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Rizal's Impact and Legacy in Dapitan</h3>
                <p>Instead of treating exile as punishment, Rizal turned it into an opportunity to help the people of Dapitan. He introduced educational reforms, provided free medical care, improved infrastructure, and engaged in agricultural and scientific projects. 
                His time in Dapitan proved that patriotism is not just about fighting but also about uplifting people's lives through knowledge, service, and innovation.</p>
                
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Religious Debates and Personal Faith</h3>
                <h4>Rizal's Debate on Religion</h4>
                <p>In Dapitan, Rizal and Fr. Pastells engaged in intellectual debates about religion. Rizal, being critical of the abuses committed by friars, held an anti-clerical stance, while Pastells tried to bring him back to the faith.
                Despite intense discussions, neither was able to change the other's beliefs, highlighting Rizal's strong convictions and critical thinking.</p>
                
                <h4>Rizal and Fr. Pastells' Friendship</h4>
                <p>Despite their religious differences, Rizal and Fr. Pastells remained good friends. Pastells gave Rizal a copy of "Imitation of Christ", a famous Catholic book, while Rizal gifted him a sculpted bust of St. Paul. 
                Their mutual respect showed that intellectual disagreements did not affect their friendship.</p>
            <h4>Rizal's Personal Faith</h4>
            <p>Although Rizal did not fully agree with Catholic doctrines, he continued to practice his faith in his own way. He attended mass and celebrated religious events, but his beliefs were based on rational inquiry rather than blind acceptance. 
            His approach to faith reflected his deep intellect and philosophical mindset.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>The Awakening of Dapitan</h3>
                <h4>A Town Transformed</h4>
                <p>When Rizal arrived in Dapitan as a prisoner in July 1892, it was a quiet and sleepy town. However, through his efforts, Dapitan transformed into a progressive and lively place. Instead of feeling defeated by his exile, Rizal maximized his time by engaging in various activities that benefited the town and its people.
                His time in Dapitan proved that patriotism is not just about fighting but also about uplifting people's lives through knowledge, service, and innovation.</p>
                
                <h4>Rizal's Productive Life in Dapitan</h4>
                <p>During his exile, Rizal focused on improving his skills and helping the community. He dedicated himself to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Art and literature by writing and creating sculptures</li>
                    <li>Agricultural and civic projects to help improve local farming and infrastructure</li>

                </ul><br/>

                <p>Rizal's contributions showcased his versatility and dedication to the betterment of society.</p>

                <h3>Rizal's Final Journey</h3> 
                <h4>Leaving Dapitan</h4>
                <p>On August 30, 1896, Luzon's eight provinces were placed under martial law as the revolution erupted. 
                Despite this, Governor-General Blanco praised Rizal's conduct in Dapitan and gave him letters of recommendation for Spanish officials in Cuba, proving he had no ties to the uprising. </p>

                <p>On September 3, 1896, Rizal boarded the Isla de Panay. Captain Alemany welcomed him and gave him the best cabin. 
                Rizal wrote to his mother, assuring her of his good health and safety. He comforted his family, saying "everything is in the hands of Divine Providence."</p>

                <p> Rizal was assigned cabin No. 22 and left for Spain, stopping near Manila. Among the passengers were Pedro Roxas, Maria Tuason, and Pedro Paterno. 
                He believed he was heading to Cuba as a doctor, but this journey would ultimately lead to his tragic fate. </p>

                <h4>Dangerous Filipino</h4>
                <p>Rizal was unaware that, upon his departure from Manila Bay, Spanish officials had already conspired against him. 
                Governor-General Blanco and the Ministers of War and Colonies labeled him a "Dangerous Filipino" and sent secret telegrams ordering his arrest upon arrival in Barcelona. </p> 
                <p>Although Rizal had no involvement in the revolution, he remained under Spanish surveillance. During his journey to Spain, Rizal heard shocking news from passengers: 
                Manila was in turmoil, and Spanish forces were executing Filipinos. He also learned that he was being falsely implicated in the revolution. </p>

                <p>A young student informed him about the atrocities happening in Cavite. 
                Disturbed by these reports, Rizal wrote to his close friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, expressing his frustration and disbelief at the unfolding events. </p>

                <h4>Rizal's Letter and New Orders</h4>
                <p>Rizal, deeply troubled, wrote a letter on September 28, 1896, to Blumentritt, expressing his shock at being accused of involvement in the revolution. 
                The next day, Captain Alemany instructed him to remain in his cabin until further orders from Manila.</p>

                <p>When Rizal reached Barcelona on October 3, 1896, he was no longer under the custody of the ship's captain but was handed over to General Eulogio Despujol—the very same man who had ordered his exile to Dapitan four years earlier. </p>

                <p>Rizal was placed under arrest and imprisoned in Montjuich Castle in Barcelona for three days. Later that evening, he was transferred to the ship Colon, which was filled with soldiers, officers, and their families. 
                The ship was bound for Manila via Singapore. </p>

                <h4>Final Days of Travel </h4>

                <p>As the ship neared land, Rizal was subjected to more restrictions. 
                Spanish officers confiscated his diary and examined it for any incriminating content, but they found nothing suspicious. He was handcuffed twice during the voyage. </p>

                <p>Sixteen hours before arriving in Singapore—the last stop before Manila—Rizal was once again placed behind bars, as Spanish authorities prepared for his return to the Philippines. 
                Rizal's friends in Europe tried to save him by seeking legal action in Singapore, but their efforts failed due to legal technicalities. </p>

                <p>Even an Englishwoman sought help from Spain's Queen Regent, but Rizal remained unaware of these attempts. 
                In the end, he was sent back to Manila to face trial, which historian Ambeth Ocampo described as a "kangaroo court that sentenced him to death." </p>
            </div>


            <div class="section">
                <h3>Thrilla in Manila</h3> 
                <p> When Rizal arrived in Manila on November 3, 1896, the Spanish authorities celebrated his capture, seeing it as a victory. 
                Meanwhile, Manila was in chaos due to the ongoing revolution, and the new Governor-General, Camilo de Polavieja, took a harsher approach by ordering public executions to spread fear.</p>

                <p>Filipinos linked to Rizal were arrested and tortured, including his brother Paciano, but they remained resilient despite the brutal treatment. The preliminary investigation on Rizal began on November 20, 1896, lasting five days. Rizal was accused before Judge Advocate Colonel Francisco Olive. 
                He was interrogated without knowing who testified against him, and two types of evidence were presented: documentary and testimonial. </p>
