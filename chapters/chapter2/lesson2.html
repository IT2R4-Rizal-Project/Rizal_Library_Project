                    <h3>Early Education</h3>
                    <p>José had a sharp mind from a young age. When he was three years old, his mother taught him the alphabet, and by the time he 
                        was five, he could read and write. </p>
                    <p>Rizal first studied under Justiniano Aquino Cruz in Biñan, before he was sent to Manila.</p>
                    <p>Paciano traveled to Biñan, Laguna, with his younger brother, Jose, in 1870 to help him enroll at Sr. Cruz, Justiniano Aquino. 
                        Because Jose would already be beginning his secondary school at Ateneo Municipal de Manila, he also accompanied him to Manila 
                        two years later. </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Education at Ateneo (1872-1877)</h3>
                <p>Rizal took first the entrance examination at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran on June 10, 1872. During that time, the Dominicans 
                had the authority to examine and regulate Ateneo, therefore the exams for new freshmen in the several colleges for boys were held 
                at Colegio de San Juan de Letran. Rizal took the test and was accepted to the Ateneo Municipal.</p>
                <p>Father Magin Ferrand (Fernando),   who was the college registrar at the time, denied Rizal admission despite the fact that he 
                    passed the entrance exam for two reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1st: He was a late registrant</li>
                        <li>2nd: He was extremely thin, pale, and undersized for an 11-year-old. </li>
                    </ul>
            
                <p>At Ateneo, students were introduced to the Jesuit System of Education, which emphasized discipline and encouraged healthy 
                    competition among learners.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The class was divided into 2 groups:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Carthaginian</strong> (the non-boarder of Ateneo) </li>
                            <li><strong>Roman</strong> (the boarder of Ateneo)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Rizal was placed at the bottom of the class and assigned with the Carthaginians.
                    <li>Students competed for these positions throughout the empire by asking those in authority to respond to questions based on 
                        the lesson for the day. 
                        <ul>
