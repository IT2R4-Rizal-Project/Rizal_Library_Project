                    <ul>
                        <li>— While some sources mention a "Julia" as someone he courted as a teenager, others consistently identify Segunda Katigbak as his first love</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                  <div class="section">
                    <h4>Segunda Katigbak</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>— Rizal's "first love"or "puppy love"They met when Rizal was 16.
                            She was a 14-year-old schoolgirl from Lipa, Batangas. Rizal met her when he was about 16. Their affection never progressed since she was already engaged to be married to another man.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                 <div class="section">
                    <h4>Leonor Valenzuela</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>— The next lady to capture Rizal's heart was a woman named Leonor Valenzuela, a tall girl of regal bearing.
                            She was Rizal's neighbor, regularly visiting her house during social gatherings.
                            Rizal courted her with love notes written with invisible ink, which could only be read by heating the note over a candle.
                            After Rizal left for Europe however, their romance ended and she accepted suitors and attended social parties.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>


                 <div class="section">
                    <h4>Leonor Rivera</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>— Rizal's sweetheart for 11 years and his second cousin. They met when Rizal was 18 and Leonor was 13.
                           A cousin of Rizal, Leonor was the inspiration and was believed that Rizal immortalized her for the character <strong>Maria Clara in Noli Me Tangere.</strong> Their relationship lasted for about 11 years, mostly through letters, but her mother disapproved of Rizal and kept his letters from reaching her. In 1890, Leonor informed Rizal she was engaged to Henry Kipping, an English railway engineer.
                           The news of Leonor Rivera's marriage to Kipping devastated Rizal.
                            Their relationship faced obstacles due to her mother's disapproval of Rizal and Paciano Rizal's disagreement with Rizal marrying before leaving for Europe. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Before Rizal returned to the Philippines on August 5, 1887, Leonor Rivera and her family had relocated to Dagupan, Pangasinan. To protect Rivera’s family from potential harm, Rizal’s father prohibited him from visiting her, as Rizal had already been branded a <em>filibustero </em>or subversive by the Spanish criollo elite because of his novel Noli Me Tángere.
                            Rizal wanted to marry Rivera while he was still in the Philippines because she had been so faithful to him. Rizal asked permission from his father one more time before his second departure from the Philippines, but he never met her again.
                        </li>

                           She was educated and helped Rizal adapt to Japanese culture. When Rizal left for the United States, he told her in a note that he had spent a happy golden month with her and that he do not know if he can have another. Rizal considered settling in Japan because of her, but his patriotic mission led him to leave for Europe.

                        <li>Her affection for Rizal was clear, she spent more time assisting him than their other boarders and showered him with all her attention.
                            ultimately though, Rizal backed out from the romance and decided to leave London for Paris abruptly in 1889 to be away from Gertrude so that she may forget him.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            After learning of Leonor Rivera’s marriage to Henry Kipping, Rizal entertained the thoughts of courting another woman.
                            The center of this idea would be the highly educated, cheerful, athletic, beautiful and morally upright Nellie. 
                        </li>
                        <li>One of the more memorable things about their romance was when Antonio Luna, who made rather distasteful comments about her, and Rizal almost had a duel to the death, only being stopped when Luna apologized for his comments, conceding Nellie to Rizal in a most chivalrous way.</li>
                        <li>Unfortunately, their relationship did not end in marriage as Rizal did not want to convert to Protestantism as Nellie demanded, and when the time Rizal had to leave had come, they parted as friends with no hard feelings.</li>

                             Rizal however did not seem to reciprocate the feelings as intensely as her. Rizal did not even mention her in his letters to his friends. When the time that Rizal had to (once again) leave, she wept, Rizal only leaving her with a box of chocolates.   
                        </li>
                        <li>Two months later, she wrote him a letter, saying <em>"after your departure, I did not take the chocolate. The box is still intact as on the day of our parting. Don't delay too long writing us because I wear out the soles of my shoes for running to the mailbox to see if there is a letter from you.
                            There will never be any home in which you are loved as in the Brussels, so, you little bad boy, hurry up and come back..."</em>

She was the adopted daughter of George Taufer from Hong Kong, who had traveled to Dapitan to consult Rizal for an eye condition.</li>
                        <li>Rizal felt a physical attraction toward her. Perhaps driven by loneliness and boredom, he found in her a welcome distraction—and once again, he fell in love. However, the Rizal sisters were suspicious of Josephine, believing she might be a friar's spy and viewing her as a potential danger to Rizal’s safety.</li>
                        <li>Taufer's double cataract was beyond Rizal's help, but he fell in love with Bracken. Taufer vehemently opposed the union but finally yielded. Bracken accompanied Taufer to Manila on his way back to Hong Kong, together with Rizal's sister, Narcisa, on March 14, 1895.</li>
                        <li>They attempted to get married, but due to Rizal's controversial reputation stemming from his writings and political views, the local priest, Father Obach, would only agree to officiate the ceremony if Rizal secured approval from the Bishop of Cebu. However, since Rizal declined to return to the Catholic faith, the bishop denied the request for a ecclesiastical marriage.</li>
                        <li>After accompanying her father to Manila and before returning to Dapitan to live with Rizal, Josephine took the opportunity to meet members of Rizal’s family in the city. Rizal’s mother proposed a civil marriage, considering it a lesser sacrament but a more acceptable option for Rizal’s conscience than making a political retraction just to obtain the bishop’s approval.</li>
                        <li>Rizal and Josephine lived together as husband and wife in a common-law relationship in Talisay, Dapitan. They had a son who, sadly, died just a few hours after birth. Rizal named the child <em>Francisco Rizal y Bracken</em>, in honor of his father.</li>
                        <li>She witnessed the events of the Tejeros Convention before heading back to Manila. Although summoned by the Governor-General, she was not subject to forced deportation due to her stepfather's American citizenship. Nevertheless, she chose to leave on her own and returned to Hong Kong. Eventually, she married a Filipino, Vicente Abad, a mestizo who worked as an agent for the Tabacalera company in the Philippines.
                            A daughter, <em>Dolores Abad y Bracken</em>, was born to the couple on April 17, 1900. A later testimony of Abad affirms that her mother <em>"was already suffering from tuberculosis of the larynx"</em> at the time of the wedding.
                            She passed away from tuberculosis in Hong Kong on March 15, 1902, and was laid to rest in the Happy Valley Cemetery. She was immortalized by Rizal in the final stanza of Mi Último Adiós, referring to her as <em>“Farewell, sweet stranger, my friend, my joy…”</em></li>
