                <h3>Claveria Decree</h3>
                <p>José's parents leased a Dominican hacienda and its adjoining rice plantation. Following <strong>Governor General Narciso Clavería y 
                    Zaldúa's</strong> 1849 proclamation requiring Filipinos to adopt Spanish surnames for census purposes despite having Spanish 
                    names already. </p>
                <p>This proclamation, also known as the <strong><em>Clavería Decree</em></strong> of November 21, 1849, required Filipinos to adopt 
                    surnames from an official catalogue for administrative and legal purposes. Contrary to popular belief, the decree did not 
                    mandate that Filipinos exclusively adopt Spanish surnames. Rather, it allowed the use of both Spanish and indigenous (native) 
                    names that were listed in the catalogue.</p>
                <p>The catalogue in question is the <em>Catálogo Alfabético de Apellidos</em> (English: Alphabetical Catalogue of Surnames). Prior 
                    to this decree, many Filipinos did not have fixed surnames and often used patronymic naming conventions (e.g., “Juan, son of 
                    Pedro”). The decree required them to choose a surname from the approved list. Some individuals retained their native surnames 
                    if these were included in the catalogue, while others adopted Spanish ones.</p>

                <h3>Encomienda System</h3>
                <p>The Dominican friars virtually owned the town of Calamba and its haciendas at the time, hence, non-Spanish families were only 
                    renting the lands they tilled and were subject to pay taxes, mostly excessive in money or kind.</p>
                <p>The encomienda system left people very vulnerable to cruelty and discrimination from the Dominican friars. Despite those 
                    cruelties, Calamba still offered opportunities. Rizal himself wrote a poem reminiscing about his happy moment in the town 
                    of Calamba, entitled “<em>Un Recuerdo A Mi Pueblo</em>” (In Memory of My Town).</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Rizal Family</h3>
                <p>The Rizal Family belonged to the <em>principalia</em>, an aristocratic town of distinguished families. The family was able to live well
                     by the dint of honest and hard work and frugal living. They get their living from the farms, which were rented from the 
                     Dominican Order; they harvested rice, corn, and sugarcane. They raised pigs, chickens, and turkeys in their backyard. </p>
                <p>Doña   Teodora,   Rizal’s mother, managed a general goods store and operated a small flour-mill and a home-made ham press.
                    They owned a carriage, which was a status symbol of the ilustrados in Spanish Philippines and a private library 
                    (the  largest in Calamba) which consisted of more than 1,000 volumes.</p>
                <p>The Rizal family had a simple, contented, and happy life. Don Francisco and Doña Teodora loved their children, but they never 
                    spoiled them. They were strict parents and trained their children to love God, to behave well, to be obedient, and to respect 
                    people, especially the old folks. They discipline their children whenever they got into mischief. They believed in the maxim, 
                    "Spare the rod and spoil the child.”</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>22 June 1861</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He was baptized JOSE RIZAL MERCADO at the Catholic of Calamba by the parish priest Rev. Rufino Collantes with 
                                Rev. Pedro Casañas as the sponsor.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>28 September 1862</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The parochial church of Calamba and the canonical books, including the book in which Rizal’s baptismal records 
                                were entered, were burned.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1864</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>By three years old, Rizal learned the alphabet from his mother.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1865</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When he was four years old, his sister Conception, the eight child in the Rizal family, died at the age of three. 
                                It was on this occasion that Rizal remembered having shed real tears for the first time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1865 – 1867</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>During this time his mother taught him how to read and write. His father hired Leon Monroy who, for five months 
                                until his (Monroy) death, taught Rizal the rudiments of Latin.</li>
                            <li>At about this time two of his mother’s cousin frequented Calamba. Uncle Manuel Alberto, seeing Rizal frail in body,
                                 concerned himself with the physical development of his young nephew and taught the latter love for the open air 
                                 and developed in him a great admiration for the beauty of nature, while Uncle Gregorio, a scholar, instilled into 
                                 his mind a love for education. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>6 June 1868</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He went to Antipolo with his father. From there they proceeded to Manila and visited his sister Saturnina who was 
                                at the time studying in the La Concordia College in Sta. Ana.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1869</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At the age of eight, Rizal wrote his first poem entitled "Sa Aking Mga Kabata” (To My Fellow Youth). However, some
                                 historians question this claim due to the lack of solid evidence, and many believe that José Rizal was not the 
                                 true author.</li>
                            <li>The attribution of Sa Aking Mga Kabata to José Rizal primarily stems from Gabriel Beato Francisco, a Tagalog writer
                                 and journalist. He published the poem in 1906 in Jose Rizal: Sa Gunita ng Isang Pilipino, asserting that he 
                                 received it from Gabriel Bernardo, a friend of Rizal’s older brother, Paciano. However, no original manuscript 
                                 in Rizal’s handwriting has ever been discovered.
                                Later, Hermenegildo Cruz, a historian and writer, included the poem in his 1909 book Kun Sino ang Kumatha ng 
                                Florante, further promoting the idea that Rizal authored it. Despite this, linguistic studies and historical 
                                inconsistencies have raised serious doubts about its authenticity.
                                Today, most scholars agree that Sa Aking Mga Kabata was likely not written by Rizal and may have been mistakenly, 
                                or even deliberately, attributed to him.</li>

                <h3>His Origins</h3>
                <p>The Mercado-Rizal lineage had Chinese, Spanish, and Filipino ancestry, which influenced Rizal’s perspectives on social justice 
                    and equality.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mestizo Origin</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Rizals were a mestizo family, like many others in the Philippines. Through his father's ancestor 
                                <strong>Domingo Lam-co</strong>, a Hokkien Chinese merchant who went to the Philippines in the late 17th century, José's 
                                patrilineal lineage could be traced back to Fujian, China. </li>
                            <li>In 1697, Lam-co married the daughter (Ines de la Rosa) of his Chinese friend Augustin Chin-co, converted to 
                                Catholicism, and changed his name to <strong>Domingo Mercado</strong> in order to avoid the harsh anti-Chinese prejudice that 
                                existed in the Philippines. </li>
                            <li>He also had Spanish ancestry. The grandmother of his mother, Teodora, Regina Ochoa, was of mixed Spanish, Chinese, 
                                and Tagalog ancestry. Lorenzo Alberto Alonzo, a half-Spanish engineer, was his maternal grandfather. 
                                The great-great-grandfather of José Rizal's mother, Eugenio Ursua, was Japanese. </li>

                            <li>Francisco Rizal lost his father when he was just eight years old. In Biñan, he went to a Latin school that his sons 
                                would later attend. Additionally, he studied Latin and philosophy at the Colegio de San Jose in Manila. He was 
                                characterized by Rafael Palma: <em>"He was 40, of solid shoulders, strong constitution, rather tall than short, of 
                                serious and reflective mien, with prominent forehead and large dark eyes. A pure Filipino."</em></li>

                            <li>Teodora was an educated lady who became a housewife, committed to providing for her family's necessities. Teodora 
                                Alonso was also a representative in the Spanish Courts and a devout Catholic, holding the rank of Knight of the 
                                Order of Isabella. Similar to her mother, who was well-bred and had a foundation in literature and mathematics,

                                basic education. Saturnina had always been a loving ‘Ate’ Neneng to Jose. When their mother was imprisoned, 
                                Saturnina brought the young Jose to Tanauan during the summer vacation of  1873  just  to cheer  up  the  sad  
                                little brother.</li>
                            <li><strong>September 26, 1882</strong> - Neneng offered a diamond ring to Jose, worrying that he had no sufficient money to spend.</li>
                            <li><strong>June 1885</strong> - Saturnina and her husband sent one hundred pesos (P100) to Jose as their contribution to Jose’s 
                                expenses in finishing his doctorate degree. </li>
                            <li>Recent controversial story mentions Saturnina as being with her mother when the latter  allegedly  tried  to  poison  Teodora  Formoso,  the  wife  of  Jose  Alberto  (Teodora Alonso’s brother).
                                The story further alleges that Saturnina and her uncle Jose Alberto were the real parents of Soledad, the supposed youngest sister of Jose.
                            </li>
                            <li>In 1909, Doña Saturnina published Pascual Poblete’s Tagalog translation of the Noli Me Tangere. Jose Rizal, on the other hand, immortalized his sister Neneng through the oil painting he made of her, which is now housed in theRizal Shrine in Fort Santiago.</li>

                            <li>Paciano played an important role in influencing Rizal's nationalist views and was actively engaged in the rebellion

                            <li>Growing up, he saw firsthand the crimes committed by the Spanish colonial administration and the clergy. Paciano, 
                                Felipe Buencamino, and Gregorio Sancianco were among the original members of La Juventud Liberal, a reformist 
                                student organization led by Padre José Burgos and operated under the auspices of the Comite de Reformadores, 
                                when he was a young student. </li>
                            <li>Paciano actively backed the Propaganda Movement for Social Reforms, including its newspaper, Diariong Tagalog. 
                                He solicited money for the nationalist newspaper and collected donations to finance that organization as 
                                a supporter of the cause. </li>
                            <li>On the recommendation of his brother Paciano and the Mercado family, Jose Rizal omitted the final three names 
                                that comprised his complete name when he enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, changing his name to 
                                "José Protasio Rizal." </li>
                            <li>After the execution of his younger brother, Paciano moved to Cavite to join General Emilio Aguinaldo in January 
                                1897. He was elected Secretary of Finance in the Central Luzon Departmental Government after being made brigadier 
                                general of the revolutionary forces.</li>
                            <li>In Laguna, he led the Filipino soldiers throughout the Philippine–American War (1899–1913). He was caught by U.S. 
                                troops in Laguna in 1900, but he was soon released and settled in the village of Los Baños, Laguna. </li>
                            <li> A descendant explained that Paciano—unlike his brother who even frequented photo studios for his pictures—did not want to be photographed. The reason was that <em>“he was a wanted man in the past and if there were no photographs of him, then it would be hard for the authorities to arrest him. He could walk everywhere without being recognized”.</em></li>
                            <li>According to his grandchildren, Paciano had a very fair complexion and rosy cheeks. His descendants were quick to add that their lolo was more handsome than the national hero, and  much  taller,  about  5’7”  to  5’9. <em>“When  he  died  and  the  body  was  brought  to  the funeraria,  his  feet  stuck  out  of  the  coffin,  which  was  too  small  for  him”.</em></li>
                            <li>This description though was neither relative nor one-sided, for it was confirmed by Jose Rizal himself. In a letter to Blumentritt, he wrote:<em>“[Paciano] is more refined and serious than I, taller, more slender, and fairer in complexion than I with a nose that is fine, beautiful and sharp pointed, but he is bow-legged”.</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Narcisa Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (1852-1939)</strong>
                        <li><h5>The Hospitable Sister of the Hero</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Narcisa was perhaps the most hospitable among the siblings. Similar to Saturnina, Narcisa provided financial 
                                support for Rizal's education in Europe, even pawning her jewelry and selling her clothing when necessary.</li>
                            <li> Narcisa was perhaps the most hospitable among the siblings. When Don Francisco and Doña Teodora were driven out of their house in Calamba, Narcisa took them in her house. It was with Narcisa also that Josephine Bracken once stayed, when the rest of Rizal's family were suspicious that Rizal’s girlfriend was a spy for the Spanish friars.</li>
                            <li>In August 1896, while being kept under arrest aboard the cruiser Castilla anhored off Cavite, Rizal thanked 
                                Narcisa, in a letter, for her hospitality in letting Josephine stay in her home. </li>
                            <li>Narcisa was also the one who laboriously looked for the location where the authorities had secretly buried Rizal. 
                                At the Paco cemetery, she discovered freshly turned ground where a body had been laid without a box of any type 
                                and without any kind of identification on the grave. She knowingly gave the custodian a present that would 
                                identify the location with Rizal's initials in reverse, "RPJ." </li>
                            <li>Narcisa and Antonino had eight children. Their son Antonio (1878-1928) married his first cousin  Emiliana  Rizal,  the  daughter  of  Paciano  Rizal  by  Severina  Decena.  Narcisa’s daughter Angelica, who had visited Rizal in Dapitan, joined the Katipunan after her uncle’s martyrdom.</li>
                            <li>Narcisa’s grandchildren revealed that their lolo, Antonino Lopez was actually the son of the priest Leoncio Lopez—the <em>‘cura parroco’ </em>of  Calamba  from  whom  Rizal  based  the  character  of  <strong>Fr.  Florentino  in  his  El  Fili.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Olympia Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (1855-1887)</strong>
                        <li><h5>The Sister Whom the Hero Loves to Tease</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>She is the fourth child in the Rizal family. Jose loved to tease her, sometimes good-humoredly describing her as 
                                his stout sister.</li>
                            <li>Segunda Katigbak, Jose's first love, was Olimpia's classmate at La Concordia College. Olympia volunteered to act as 
                                a mediator between the two teenage lovers when Rizal told her about Segunda.  </li>
                            <li>In one of Jose’s letters to his other sisters in Calamba, he wrote, “Is Sra. Ipia (Señora Olympia) there already? 
                                Do her eyes still become small when she laughs?” Wherever Olympia and Silvestre (Olympia’s husband, Silvestre 
                                Ubaldo) were, they corresponded with Jose, telling him updates about the family, like about their son Aristeo.</li>
                            <li>March 1887, Olympia informed Jose that her husband was assigned in Manila and that their parents were in good health. Paradoxically, Olympia died of hemorrhage while giving birth  on  September  that  same  year—an  event  that  spoiled  Rizal’s  homecoming.</li>
                            <li> Olympia’s husband did not escape the Spaniards’ persecution. With Paciano, Ubaldo was deported to Mindoro because of the Calamba agrarian trouble. In December 1891, he nonetheless escaped from further oppression in the Philippines and arrived at Hong Kong with Paciano and Don Francisco to join Dr. Rizal there.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Lucia Alonso Rizal Realonda Herbosa (1857–1919) </strong>
                        <li><h5>Partaker of the Hero's Sufferings</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lucia’s husband Mariano died during the cholera epidemic in May 1889.  In Jose’s article in  La  Solidaridad 
                                entitled  Una profanacion(‘A  Profanation’), he  scornfully  attacked  the friars for declining to bury in ‘sacred 
                                ground’ a ‘good Christian’ simply because he was the “brother-in-law of Rizal”. </li>
                            <li>In December 1891, the then widowed Lucia was among Rizal’s siblings who were present in their so-called ‘family reunion’  in  Hong Kong. She also accompanied Jose when he returned to Manila in June the following year.</li>
                            <li>From July 6 to 15, 1892, Jose however was regrettably  imprisoned  in  Fort  Santiago  and  later  deported  to  Dapitan  on  a  made-up charge that anti-friar pamphlets were found in Lucia’s luggage on board Don Juan</li>
                            <li> Lucia and Mariano’s children were Delfina, Concepcion, Patrocinio, Teodosio, Estanislao, Paz, Victoria,  and  Jose. 
                                Delfina (1879  –1900) became  renowned for being one of the three  women  (along  with  Marcela  Agoncillo  and  
                                her  daughter  Lorenza) who  seamed together the Philippine flag.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Maria Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (1859-1945) </strong>
                        <li><h5>The Hero's Confidant</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It was to her whom Jose talked about  wanting  to  marry Josephine  Bracken  when  the  majority  of  the  Rizal  
                                family  was apparently not amenable to the idea. In his letter dated December 12, 1891, Jose had also brought up 
                                to Maria his plan of establishing a Filipino colony in North British Borneo. </li>
                            <li>José letter dated December 28, 1891, he wrote to Maria, “I'm told that your children are very pretty.” Today, we 
                                have a historical proof that Maria’s progenies were indeed nice-looking  (‘lahing  maganda’).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Concepcion Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (1862-1865)  </strong>
                        <li><h5>The Hero's First Grief</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>She is also called ‘Concha’ by her siblings, Concepcion Rizal (1862-1865) was the eight child of the Rizal family. 
                                She died at the age of three. Of his sisters, it is said that Pepe loved most the little Concha who was a year 
                                younger than him. Jose played games and shared children stories with her, and from her he felt the beauty of 
                                sisterly love.</li>
                            <li> When Concha  died of sickness in 1865, Jose mournfully wept at losing her. He later wrote in his memoir, <em>“When I 
                                was four years old, I lost my little sister Concha, and then for the first time I shed tears caused by love and 
                                grief.” </em>   From Concha’s life we could learn that not a few children in those times died young. If records are 
                                correct, more than ten of Rizal’s nieces and nephews also died young, not to mention that Jose’s child himself 
                                experienced the same fate.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Josefa Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (1865-1945) </strong>
                        <li><h5> The Katipunera ("Panggoy")</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Among  Jose’s  letters  to  Josefa,  the  one  dated  October  26  1893  is  perhaps  the  most fascinating. 
                                Written  in English,  the  letter  addressed Josefa  as  “Miss Josephine Rizal”, thereby making her the namesake 
                                of Rizal’s girlfriend Josephine Bracken.</li>
                            <li>After Jose’s martyrdom, the epileptic Josefa joined the Katipunan and is even supposed to have been elected the 
                                president of its women section.</li>
                            <li>She was one of the original 29 women admitted to the Katipunan along with Gregoria de Jesus, wife of Andres 
                                Bonifacio. They safeguarded the secret papers and documents of the society and danced and sang during  sessions  
                                so  that civil  guards  would think  that  the  meetings  were  just  harmless social gatherings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Trinidad Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (1868-1951) </strong>
                        <li><h5>The Custodian of the Hero's Greatest Poem</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>‘Trining’ was the tenth child  and the custodian of Rizal’s last and greatest poem. In March 1886, Jose wrote to 
                                Trining describing how the German women were serious in studying. He thus advised her: <em>“now that you are still 
                                young and you have time to learn, it is necessary that you study by reading and reading attentively.”</em></li>
                            <li>In August 1893, Trinidad, along with their mother, joined Rizal in Dapitan and resided with him in his casa 
                                cuadrada (square house). It is said that Trinidad had once planned Rizal’s escape from his exile. In January 1896, 
                                Jose invited Trinidad to return to Dapitan. Jose though had one hesitation: “The difficulty is, whom are you going 
                                to marry here? The town is lonely still, for there is almost no one.”</li>
                            <li>Never married, Trinidad and Josefa lived together until their deaths. Right before Jose’s execution, Trinidad and 
                                their mother visited him in the Fort Santiago prison cell. As they were leaving, Jose handed over to Trining an 
                                alcohol cooking stove, a gift from the Pardo de Taveras, whispering to her in a language which the guards could not 
                                understand, <em>“There is something in it.” </em> That ‘something’ was Rizal’s elegy now known as  <strong>“Mi  Ultimo  Adios.”</strong></li>
                            <li>Like  Josefa  and  two  nieces,  Trinidad  joined  the  Katipunan  after Rizal’s death.   In  1883,  Trining  was  
                                in  bed  for  five months,  from  April  to  August,  being  sick  with intermittent fever—that kind which rises 
                                and falls and then returns, occurring in diseases such as malaria. Astonishingly however, she was the last of the 
                                family to die.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Soledad Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (1870-1929) </strong>
                        <li><h5>The Hero's Controversial Sister ("Choleng")</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Being a teacher, she was arguably the best educated among Rizal’s sisters. In his long and meaty letter to Choleng 
                                dated June 6, 1890, Jose told her sister that he was proud of her for becoming a teacher. He thus counseled her to 
                                be a model of virtues and good qualities <em>“for the one who should teach should be better than the persons who need 
                                her learning.”</em></li>
                            <li>Rizal nonetheless used the topic as leverage in somewhat rebuking her sister for getting  married  to  Pantaleon  
                                Quintero  of  Calamba without  their  parents’  consent.  He said to Choleng, <em>“If you have a sweetheart, behave 
                                towards  him  nobly  and  with  dignity, instead  of  resorting  to  secret  meetings  and conversations which do 
                                nothing but lower a woman's worth in the eyes of a man… You should value more, esteem more your honor and you will 
                                be more esteemed and valued.”</em> </li>
                        </ul>
